\documentclass{qmolist}

%%% READ THIS CAREFULLY %%%

% make sure you have this file in the same directory as qmolist.cls

% the cls includes several macros you can (and should) use:
% use \nl if you want to start a new line -- this is extremely important for uniformity
% you can use \N, \Z, \Q, \R, \C to write sets' names
% if two parentheses contain fractions, powers etc, use \( ... \), this will format them correctly
% if the parentheses are not round, you should use \left and \right

% the cls should contain every package you could possibly need, but if you need others tell me on discord

% you can use both tkz-euclide and asymptote for diagrams (they're already included in the cls)
% but if you use asymptote, you'll need to create a separate asy file and use \asyinclude{file.asy}
% because inline asymptote won't work inside the solution environment

% for claims and lemmas use
% \begin{claim}
%	...
% \end{claim}
% and change "claim" with "lemma" if needed

\begin{document}
\soltrue % this line is vital, don't touch it
\begin{problem}{author's name}
	% problem statement here
\end{problem}
\begin{solution*}{solver's name}
	% use "solution*" if you're only including one solution
	% otherwise use "solution" and write as many as you want
	% if you want to add solutions you should begin a new environment for each solution
\end{solution*}
\begin{remark}
	% you don't necessarily need to include a remark
	% in case, delete this environment
\end{remark}
\end{document}
